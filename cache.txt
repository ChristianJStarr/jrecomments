When you control for GPA, test scores, and even recommendation letters and extra-curricular activities, asians are substantially less likely to get into certain universities, opposed to black, Hispanic, and even other white students. This is done by changing the criteria for admissions as a pretext for racial categorization and discrimination. For instance, when determining criteria like &#39;courage,&#39; elite universities often have in-person (or zoom) interviews to &#39;observe&#39; the interviewee. Since admissions officials cannot bump test scores and GPAs, they observe the interviewee and adjust the soft factors up or down depending on the race/ethnicity of the interviewee. <br><br>SCOTUS has basically enforced this approach. Attempts at using strict points bonuses for certain races were declared unconstitutional, as well as other discrete forms of measuring race and adding/subtracting points based on race. But, the Court stopped short of disallowing race as a factor in admissions, citing the supposed &#39;benefit&#39; of having a racially diverse student body. Of course, what the Court didn&#39;t mention was what that diverse body should and could look like, so universities have a blank slate to decide what makup of the student body is considered &#39;diverse,&#39; and then enforce this outcome by burying the racial prejudice into these soft factors, where the intent of the admissions officers can be plausibly denied. After all, it&#39;s easy to answer the question &quot;did you discriminate against this particular applicant?&quot; with &quot;no, I just thought that particular applicant didn&#39;t display enough courage, or energy, or whatever,&quot; while the overall trend showing that asians, as a group, are being penalized for their race.

Like a last name... 1/3rd of the population in india, china, and japan are basically considered Subhuman because of certain Last names and other social conditions, these people are not allowed to own houses or land, not allowed to work basically anywhere unless its prostitution or the criminal underworld.. they cant get ID&#39;s, and their tantamount to trash and sometimes sold into slavery... their called Untouchables, in their languages.. and thats THEIR OWN PEOPLE, so when another race comes around.. spanish, black and even White in alot of cases, these people are shunned, and sometimes targeted and killed because locals think these people are like pinatas that are gonna have gold pop out of their bodies... Lol.. People have no idea how bad it REALLY is in the world.. and this shit takes time, a looong time... its been a few damn years since this started... and people want to dig back a decade or longer and destroy lives... of course you&#39;ll find bad shit in the past...
