A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

I despise Fox News as I remember when they were grifting for neocons full-time, but they have had a better record of accuracy in reporting than CNN, MSNBC, or any of the alphabet networks over the last four years.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects.

How do you go to Heaven? What does the Bible say about salvation?<br><br>Here\u2019s salvation plain and simple:<br>All have fallen short of God\u2019s glory and perfect moral standard: all have sinned (Romans 3:23), and just one sin makes us deserving of Hell (James 2:10). I\u2019ve lied, you\u2019ve lied . . pretty simple.<br><br>God requires absolute perfection to enter Heaven because He is perfectly holy and righteous. God doesn\u2019t want us to be separated from Him, He loves us and<br>He loves you . . .the Bible says He is a loving friend who sticks closer than a brother. Would a loving God make salvation difficult? Of course not!\u00a0 What did He do to fix this sin problem? God left Glory in Heaven, manifested Himself in the flesh as a human, Jesus Christ, never once sinned, perfectly fulfilled the law, did not deserve punishment, yet He became OUR sin for US. John the Baptist said about Jesus: \u201cBehold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d Colossians 2:14 says \u201cBlotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;\u201d And, right before Jesus died, He declared \u201cIt is finished!\u201d In other words, the debt of sin<br>has been paid off in full (past, present, and future sins) by His death on the cross. He finished all of the work, and thus, there is no<br>work for you to do. Ephesians 2:8-9 says \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that NOT OF YOURSELVES: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d After this, He was buried in a tomb. On the third day, He bodily resurrected from the grave and was seen alive by over 500 people at once and also the disciples and the apostles. Hard for you to believe in the resurrection? Well, these disciples and apostles, like Paul, went on to preach this Gospel, were severely persecuted, and suffered horrific deaths for their faith.<br>Would they suffer trials and death for a lie?<br><br>How do you accept this free gift of salvation and forgiveness of all your sins so that you can be promised everlasting life? Jesus answers this in John 3:16 \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d When Jesus spoke to Martha, He said: \u201c . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that BELIEVETH in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and BELIEVETH in me shall NEVER DIE. Believest thou this?\u201d (John 11:25-26).<br><br>Do you notice a common theme here? To be saved, all you must do is believe the Gospel, that the Lord Jesus Christ died for all your sins past, present, and future, was buried, and rose from death on the third day, and trust in that alone for your salvation believing that you can never lose your salvation because Jesus paid it all. The instant you do that, God seals you with the Holy Spirit of Promise and promises you everlasting life. Therefore, since salvation does not depend on your own behavior or<br>works or commitment to God or maintaining your faith, but depends solely on Jesus\u2019 finished payment for your sin on the cross and defeat of death when He rose from it, you can be 100% sure that you will go<br>to Heaven. 1 John 5:13 says \u201cThese things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.\u201d<br><br>I pray that today is the day of your salvation. Jesus loves you, and I love you too. The book of John and Romans are great places to start in a KJV Bible. God bless you. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. :)<br><br>Here are some additional verses:<br><br>Acts 16:30-31 \u201cAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d<br><br>John 6:28-29 \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d<br><br>John 6:40 \u201cAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d<br><br>John 5:24 \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall<br>not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\u201d<br><br>Titus 3:5 \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\u201d", "2021-06-07T05:31:51Z", 0], ["Expendable4 H00", "@\ua9c1Ian Moone\ua9c2 context is important.

Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

So not fascinating in the least in all its unglorious dark ignorance and arrogance that the nonexistent ego puts so much value into what can&#39;t even take possession of.<br><br>A &quot;theorist&quot; in conspiracies, or in anything for that matter, in the true sense of the word, can never be &quot;right&quot; nor correct, factual, knowledgeable, etc....as it wouldn&#39;t be regarded as a &quot;theory&quot; any longer but considered a fact, or something called &quot;knowledge&quot; which humans use this concept as a form of escapism from their ignorance they have spun quite the tale about how ignorance is so shameful and is to blame for their woes and must be avoided at all costs. Yet with all their knowledge they have obtained with their self-acclaimed &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;informed,&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot; minds they have not avoided their woes nor their ignorance, they have only deluded themselves with their own self-deceptions.<br><br>That&#39;s nothing special in and of itself. Fuck a theory, now ponder what is a &quot;fact?&quot; Facts are not superior to any theory. &quot;In fact,&quot; they are only different when distinctions are thought to be something of substance that is real despite space has no distinctive form to it, but are objects &quot;real&quot; while the space they appear in unreal? Distinctive qualities don&#39;t make for a reality, as to believe that bullshit is to believe that space is nonexistent and only apparent objects exist. <br><br>Everything science has staken a claim to have obtained in discoveries through scientific methods of research and study only to have it later &quot;proven&quot; to be inconclusive and was not actually what they thought it was, a &quot;fact.&quot; Facts, such as the notion the universe is made of physical matter, turns out according to science to not be a fact, the universe is not made of physical matter, but now science claims it is made of energy and &quot;dark matter&quot; which ironically they don&#39;t know what &quot;dark matter&quot; even is. Apparently, you CAN make this shit up after all. It seems scientists do, AND so do all these know-it-all non-scientists who rely on dreaming up opinions based upon their imagination and using their ignorance to explain what they &quot;know&quot; or &quot;think&quot; which knowing and thinking seems to be synonymous in meaning for them. <br><br>Billions of humans despite science having since debunked its own &quot;facts&quot; still believe the universe is made of physical matter as if was their own discovery that they never got such an idea from science. <br><br>So if scientific evidence to support a &quot;fact&quot; turns out to be not a fact after all, then when was it ever really a &quot;fact&quot; to begin with? A better question perhaps is to ask, why are scientists relying on methods that are evidently suggesting they are fallible methods only to replace a fact that isn&#39;t a fact with yet another fact through the same fucking method that didn&#39;t get them anywhere, but further reinforces their mind in its insane ignorance and their attachment to their ignorance becomes even more desperate and hopeless as they refuse to accept their reality?", "2021-06-05T20:33:23Z", 0], ["Concrete Lightbulb", "@Darran Kern <b>&quot;The right is always right&quot;</b> - Did the virus magically disappear last April due to warmer weather?", "2021-06-05T19:40:24Z", 0], ["Robert Murphy", "It&#39;s only like the 80th time this year... lol", "2021-06-05T19:14:08Z", 1]]], ["\u201cP.S.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

An untested rushed vaccine? Are you old? If you are 80 years old I understand that the death rate of the virus (at 80yrs old you still have a 94%!!!

If you are under 55 and even somewhat healthy you have a 99.997% survival rate! And that\u2019s IF you get the virus. It\u2019s the fucking flu. In 2018 there were over a million hospitalizations for serious flu cases and thousands and thousands of deaths. Guess how many there were in 202??? FOUR! FOUR! So what does that tell you? That magically the flu went away. Or that hospitals were reporting flu patients as Covid patients??? This might help. The US gov paid hospitals $48k for each Covid patient and 140k for each Covid death. So what did hospitals do? (My sister is the head of pediatric oncology in San Antonio and she showed me what they sent out to every head of each department). And I quote \u201call deaths are to be reported as Covid deaths. Unless they have a negative Covid test. All patients with any symptom of Covid are to be labeled as Covid patients\u201d (the wording was much more doc talk but saying exactly that). The thing is they do not postmortem test. So like a doctor in Min whistle blew and read the exact thing my sister got \u201csomething is going on with this Covid. They are making us report all deaths and patients as Covid. Those are then the numbers your government and media is telling you but this is a flat out lie. My patient comes in dead from a gunshot wound to the head. I know for a fact the cause of death was NOT Covid. It was a gunshot wound to the head. But the hospital is forcing me to report this as a Covid death. This is not right\u201d. Well the hospital fired that doctor for blowing the whistle on their corruption. <br><br>So again...why would you get this vaccine?  I had Covid. I had a soar throat for 15 minutes and was fine. My wife on a ton of medication for IVF got it. She was fine 3 days of having the flu and then fine. <br><br>What you really need to worry about is the corruption. They released their virus to destroy the greatest economy in world history and steal our election(S) and freedoms. <br><br>Please wake up. Dr Fucki is part of it. You think it\u2019s weird that Obama and Dr Fucki gave the Wuhan lab our tax dollars to research making Covid-19 more transmissible between humans?

You would need a respirator for that, not a surgical mask. So if you look at the use of mask to reduce the spread of the virus by people actively infected with it, sometimes without symptoms, it makes sense to you use them. If you look at mask use as as a means to prevent yourself from becoming infected by other people, of course they are ineffective unless your are using a properly fitted respirator.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

How do you go to Heaven? What does the Bible say about salvation?<br><br>Here\u2019s salvation plain and simple:<br>All have fallen short of God\u2019s glory and perfect moral standard: all have sinned (Romans 3:23), and just one sin makes us deserving of Hell (James 2:10). I\u2019ve lied, you\u2019ve lied . . pretty simple.<br><br>God requires absolute perfection to enter Heaven because He is perfectly holy and righteous. God doesn\u2019t want us to be separated from Him, He loves us and<br>He loves you . . .the Bible says He is a loving friend who sticks closer than a brother. Would a loving God make salvation difficult? Of course not!\u00a0 What did He do to fix this sin problem? God left Glory in Heaven, manifested Himself in the flesh as a human, Jesus Christ, never once sinned, perfectly fulfilled the law, did not deserve punishment, yet He became OUR sin for US. John the Baptist said about Jesus: \u201cBehold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d Colossians 2:14 says \u201cBlotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;\u201d And, right before Jesus died, He declared \u201cIt is finished!\u201d In other words, the debt of sin<br>has been paid off in full (past, present, and future sins) by His death on the cross. He finished all of the work, and thus, there is no<br>work for you to do. Ephesians 2:8-9 says \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that NOT OF YOURSELVES: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d After this, He was buried in a tomb. On the third day, He bodily resurrected from the grave and was seen alive by over 500 people at once and also the disciples and the apostles. Hard for you to believe in the resurrection? Well, these disciples and apostles, like Paul, went on to preach this Gospel, were severely persecuted, and suffered horrific deaths for their faith.<br>Would they suffer trials and death for a lie?<br><br>How do you accept this free gift of salvation and forgiveness of all your sins so that you can be promised everlasting life? Jesus answers this in John 3:16 \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d When Jesus spoke to Martha, He said: \u201c . . I am the resurrection, and the life: he that BELIEVETH in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and BELIEVETH in me shall NEVER DIE. Believest thou this?\u201d (John 11:25-26).<br><br>Do you notice a common theme here? To be saved, all you must do is believe the Gospel, that the Lord Jesus Christ died for all your sins past, present, and future, was buried, and rose from death on the third day, and trust in that alone for your salvation believing that you can never lose your salvation because Jesus paid it all. The instant you do that, God seals you with the Holy Spirit of Promise and promises you everlasting life. Therefore, since salvation does not depend on your own behavior or<br>works or commitment to God or maintaining your faith, but depends solely on Jesus\u2019 finished payment for your sin on the cross and defeat of death when He rose from it, you can be 100% sure that you will go<br>to Heaven. 1 John 5:13 says \u201cThese things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.\u201d<br><br>I pray that today is the day of your salvation. Jesus loves you, and I love you too. The book of John and Romans are great places to start in a KJV Bible. God bless you. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. :)<br><br>Here are some additional verses:<br><br>Acts 16:30-31 \u201cAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d<br><br>John 6:28-29 \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d<br><br>John 6:40 \u201cAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d<br><br>John 5:24 \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall<br>not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\u201d<br><br>Titus 3:5 \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\u201d", "2021-06-07T05:32:25Z", 0], ["Pancho Villa", "@Ace hey remember Jeffrey Epstein?

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.
